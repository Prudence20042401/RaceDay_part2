# RaceDay API - implemented endpoints (Part 2)

Role: **None** = public, **Any** = any logged-in user, otherwise that role only.
All Organiser endpoints that touch an event also check the event belongs to the logged-in Organiser.
Common failures not repeated in every row: `401 Unauthorized` (not logged in), `403 Forbidden` (wrong role / not the owner), `400 Bad Request` (invalid body).
